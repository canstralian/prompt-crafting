### Define Codex/Copilot custom instruction behavior + YAML examples

**Task**: Add a dedicated section describing custom instruction behavior for Codex and Copilot, including example rules and a full conceptual YAML block.

**Details**:
- Provide example behavioral rules (e.g., avoid dependency surprises, request clarification on ambiguity, keep scope tight).
- Include a conceptual YAML example with behavior, quality gates, async patterns, security, and observability expectations.
- Emphasize that tests and linters are required for code changes and can be skipped for documentation-only changes.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Section includes both a concise rules list and a YAML example.
- Testing/linting expectations are explicit and easy to find.
