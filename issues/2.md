### Draft comprehensive Copilot + Codex configuration guide for Trading Bot Swarm

**Task**: Create or update the Trading Bot Swarm documentation with a comprehensive guide for configuring GitHub Copilot and Codex, covering purpose/scope and a full configuration overview.

**Details**:
- Start with purpose/scope and define Copilot as a pair programmer with strict behavioral rules.
- Include configuration overview sections for:
  - Testing & linting (tests/linters for code changes, skip for doc-only).
  - Code style and conventions.
  - Async patterns (timeouts, abort signals, idempotent retries).
  - Security defaults (no hardcoded secrets, input validation, least privilege).
  - Logging/observability (structured logs, metrics, traces, alerting).
  - CI/CD integration and quality gates.
  - Version control practices (conventional commits, semantic versioning, protected branches).

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Guide has a clear purpose/scope section.
- All configuration overview bullets above are represented with actionable guidance.
