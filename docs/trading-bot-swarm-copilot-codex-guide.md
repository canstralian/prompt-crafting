# Trading Bot Swarm: GitHub Copilot + Codex Configuration Guide

## Purpose and scope
This guide standardizes how GitHub Copilot and Codex operate within the Trading Bot Swarm ecosystem. It ensures consistent quality, secure automation, and repeatable delivery across trading services, infrastructure, and data pipelines. Copilot is treated as a **pair programmer** with strict behavioral rules: follow repository conventions, respect security defaults, run required tests and linters for code changes, and avoid speculative or risky modifications. Codex follows the same expectations with heightened automation discipline, including scoped changes and explicit validation evidence.

## Configuration overview
### Testing and linting
- **Mandatory for code changes**: run unit/integration tests and linting for any change that affects runtime behavior.
- **Documentation-only changes**: skip tests/linters unless the docs reference code that must be validated.
- **Local-first validation**: validate in local/dev environments before pushing.
- **Quality gate alignment**: match CI quality gates locally to reduce pipeline failures.

### Code style
- Enforce consistent formatting through Prettier/ESLint (or language-specific equivalents).
- Prefer explicit types and interfaces for shared domain models.
- Keep functions small and composable with clear, single-responsibility boundaries.
- Align naming with trading domain terms (orders, fills, strategies, risk limits).

### Async patterns and reliability
- Prefer `async/await` over mixed callback/promise styles.
- Always use timeouts and abort signals for external I/O.
- Apply retries only to idempotent operations with exponential backoff and jitter.
- Guard critical trade flows with circuit breakers and rate-limit awareness.

### Security defaults
- Never hardcode secrets; use environment variables and managed secrets.
- Validate all external inputs (API payloads, webhooks, user data).
- Enforce least-privilege access for tokens and service accounts.
- Log securely: avoid emitting secrets or PII in logs.

### Logging and observability
- Emit structured logs (JSON) with correlation/trace IDs.
- Track metrics for trade latency, fill success rate, and strategy health.
- Use distributed tracing across exchange adapters and risk engines.
- Standardize alert thresholds for critical failures and latency spikes.

### CI/CD integration
- Define quality gates: lint, tests, type checks, and security scans.
- Block merges when quality gates fail.
- Use a consistent build pipeline across all repos.
- Rotate secrets on a fixed cadence and scope CI permissions minimally.

### Version control
- Use conventional commits and semantic versioning.
- Require PR review and automated checks prior to merge.
- Tag releases via CI for traceability.
- Prefer protected branches, signed commits, and linear history when possible.

## Custom instruction behavior for Codex and Copilot
### Example rules
- Do not bypass lint/test failures.
- Avoid unreviewed dependencies or framework changes.
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous.
- Provide diff-focused change summaries with validation notes.

## GitHub Actions workflow example (lint + test)
**Trigger conditions**
- Run on pull requests targeting `main`.
- Run on pushes to `main`.
- Skip the workflow when only documentation changes are present (optional but recommended).

**Quality gate steps**
- Checkout repository
- Set up Node.js
- Install dependencies
- Lint
- Type check (if applicable)
- Run tests

```yaml
name: quality-gate
on:
  push: &trigger_config
    branches: [main]
    paths-ignore:
      - "**/*.md"
      - "docs/**"
  pull_request: *trigger_config

jobs:
  quality-gate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: npm
      - name: Install
        run: npm ci
      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Type Check
        run: npm run typecheck
      - name: Tests
        run: npm test
```

## Semantic release and version tagging
**Best practices**
- Use conventional commits.
- Generate changelogs and version tags automatically.
- Tag releases only after quality gates pass.

```yaml
name: release
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: npm
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm test
      - run: npx semantic-release
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Security and dependency scanning
- Enable Dependabot (or Renovate) for dependency updates.
- Run static analysis and vulnerability scans in CI.
- Fail builds on critical vulnerabilities with defined SLAs.

```yaml
name: security-scan
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 3 * * 1"
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm audit --audit-level=high
      - run: npx eslint .
```

## Contributor guidelines
### Proposing changes
- Create a feature branch from `main`.
- Use conventional commit messages.
- Include tests for behavioral changes and update fixtures if needed.

### Review criteria
- Correctness and adherence to trading rules.
- Security posture (input validation, secret handling, RBAC).
- Observability coverage (logs, metrics, traces).
- Test coverage and stability.

### Validation process
- CI quality gates must pass.
- At least one approving reviewer.
- Evidence of local testing for risky changes.

## Troubleshooting and optimization tips
- **Flaky tests**: isolate external dependencies and use deterministic fixtures.
- **Slow CI**: enable caching and split lint/test jobs.
- **Lint errors**: run formatter locally before committing.
- **API throttling**: add backoff and rate-limit handling with metrics.
- **Dependency drift**: regenerate lockfiles with approved tool versions.

## Maintenance schedule
- Review this guide quarterly.
- Update for new tooling or version upgrades.
- Retire deprecated workflows and add new best practices as needed.

---
**Goal**: Standardize excellence and strengthen the reliability, performance, and safety of the Trading Bot Swarm ecosystem.
