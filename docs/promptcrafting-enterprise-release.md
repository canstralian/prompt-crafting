# Project: promptcrafting.net - Enterprise Release Preparation

## 1. Documentation Requirements

### 1.1. User Documentation
- **User guides**: Step-by-step flows for core journeys (onboarding, workspace setup, prompt creation, versioning, testing, and sharing). Include screenshots, expected outcomes, and common pitfalls.
- **Tutorials**: Scenario-based walkthroughs (e.g., “Create a prompt library,” “Run a prompt test suite,” “Publish a prompt”). Provide downloadable templates where possible.
- **FAQs**: Cover billing, workspace permissions, data retention, prompt privacy, and troubleshooting. Tag FAQs by role (admin, member, viewer).

### 1.2. Developer Documentation
- **API documentation**: Provide REST/GraphQL references (if any), webhook docs, request/response schemas, and example payloads.
- **Contribution guidelines**: Define branch naming, commit conventions, code review requirements, and local dev setup.
- **Code style specifics**: Describe TypeScript strictness, linting rules, naming conventions, and component design guidelines.

### 1.3. Architectural Documentation
- **System diagrams**: High-level diagram of the web client, API/data services, and external integrations.
- **Component descriptions**: Explain the UI layer, state management, data access layer, and auth boundaries.
- **Data flow**: Trace user actions from UI → API/data services → storage → back to UI, with auth/authorization checks.

### 1.4. Deployment Documentation
- **Infrastructure requirements**: Environments (dev/staging/prod), required secrets, and third-party dependencies.
- **Deployment scripts**: Document CI jobs, build artifacts, and environment-specific configuration.
- **Rollback procedures**: Define how to revert to a previous tag and restore data safely.

## 2. Architectural Review and Enhancements

### 2.1. Current Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: Vite + React + TypeScript SPA, using Tailwind and a shadcn-style component layer for UI consistency. ([package.json, L1-L66](</package.json#L1-L66>))
- **Data services**: Supabase client library plus project-level Supabase configuration for migrations/functions. ([package.json, L42-L66](</package.json#L42-L66>), [supabase/config.toml, L1-L2](</supabase/config.toml#L1-L2>))
- **Routing and state**: React Router for client-side navigation and React Query for async data workflows. ([package.json, L57-L66](</package.json#L57-L66>))

### 2.2. Scalability Considerations
- **Read optimization**: Introduce caching for read-heavy pages (CDN/edge caching for public pages).
- **Data partitioning**: Ensure workspace-based partitioning and role-based access checks are enforced for multi-tenancy.
- **Horizontal scaling**: Keep the app stateless; use managed DB scaling and edge functions for latency-sensitive paths.
- **Rate limiting**: Apply per-workspace or per-user throttling for sensitive endpoints (auth, sharing, invites).

### 2.3. Performance Optimization
- **Bundle optimization**: Use code-splitting on large routes, analyze bundles regularly, and prefetch critical assets.
- **API efficiency**: Reduce N+1 requests via batching, caching, and carefully scoped queries.
- **UI performance**: Virtualize long lists, memoize expensive components, and limit re-renders with stable selectors.

### 2.4. Technology Stack Review
- **Frontend**: Keep Vite + React + TypeScript; ensure upgrades are planned with monthly dependency review.
- **UI tooling**: Maintain Tailwind + component primitives; document any theme tokens and design system rules.
- **Data layer**: If Supabase remains the source of truth, formalize a data access layer and add policy tests.

## 3. OpDevSec Best Practices Implementation

### 3.1. Security Audits and Vulnerability Assessments
- **SAST**: Enable GitHub Advanced Security (CodeQL) or run Semgrep in CI.
- **SCA**: Use Dependabot/Renovate for automated dependency updates. For CI, run scans with a dedicated tool like Snyk or use `npm audit --production` to focus on production vulnerabilities, with a defined SLA.
- **Secret scanning**: Enforce secret scanning in GitHub and pre-commit hooks for local checks.
- **Pen testing**: Schedule annual third-party assessments and quarterly internal threat modeling.

### 3.2. CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements
- **Quality gates**: Lint + typecheck + tests + SCA + SAST must pass before merge.
- **Environment parity**: Use staging that mirrors production dependencies and configuration.
- **Signed builds**: Require provenance attestations (SLSA) and signed release tags.

### 3.3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Define infra**: Use Terraform/Pulumi for cloud resources, DNS, and secrets management.
- **Benefits**: Reproducible environments, drift detection, and auditable change history.
- **Policy controls**: Apply policy-as-code checks (OPA/Conftest) for compliance enforcement.

### 3.4. Monitoring and Logging
- **Metrics**: Track latency, error rates, usage per workspace, and performance budgets.
- **Logging**: Use structured logs with correlation IDs and redact secrets by default.
- **Alerting**: Set SLO-based alerts; integrate with on-call tools and incident response playbooks.

## 4. GitHub Repository Preparation

### 4.1. Repository Structure
Recommended layout:
- `/docs`: Product, architecture, and operational documentation.
- `/src`: Application source.
- `/public`: Static assets.
- `/supabase`: DB migrations and edge functions (if applicable).
- `/scripts`: Release and automation scripts.
- `/infra`: IaC definitions for cloud resources.

### 4.2. Branching Strategy
- **GitHub Flow**: Short-lived branches off `main`, PRs for all changes, and protected `main`.
- **Release branches**: For enterprise releases, create `release/x.y` with hotfix support.

### 4.3. Contribution Guidelines
- Require signed commits (or DCO) for external contributors.
- Mandate tests for behavioral changes and link to issue/feature context.
- Enforce PR templates, security checklist, and changelog updates.

### 4.4. License and Legal Considerations
- **License**: Consider Apache-2.0 for enterprise-friendly terms, or MIT for maximum simplicity.
- **Legal disclaimers**: Include limitations of liability, warranty disclaimers, and a security policy.

## 5. Release Checklist

### 5.1. Code Review Process
- Minimum of two approving reviewers for core modules.
- Security-focused review on auth, sharing, and data access paths.
- Require CI green status before merge.

### 5.2. Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Core business logic and permission checks.
- **Integration tests**: Supabase access patterns and auth workflows.
- **E2E tests**: Critical user journeys (signup, workspace creation, prompt creation/testing, sharing).
- **Performance tests**: Baseline load tests on staging with budget thresholds.

### 5.3. Release Notes
Template:

### 5.4. Rollback Plan
- Maintain prior release artifacts and tags.
- Define data rollback steps (migrations, backups, and recovery windows).
- Use feature flags to isolate newly released functionality.

## 6. Team Training and Knowledge Transfer

### 6.1. Documentation Training
- Workshop on documentation standards, templates, and approval flow.
- Teach updates for product changes and versioned release notes.

### 6.2. OpDevSec Training
- Quarterly training on threat modeling, secure coding, and incident response.
- Hands-on drills: secret leaks, dependency CVEs, and access control regressions.

**Goal**: Ensure promptcrafting.net is release-ready with enterprise-grade documentation, architecture clarity, and OpDevSec resilience.
